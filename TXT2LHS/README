This utility converts FORTH code written in a text editor or IDE into the required block format for the proSeed (and some other FORTH devices).

The format of each block is 16 lines by 64 columns with a 6 character block/line tag at the beginning of each line.

Current Functionality:
- formats code into blocks
- removes all empty lines to compress code

Problems:
- lines longer than 64 characters are truncated, this can cause serious errors
- the --> operator needs to be added so the LOAD command knows to continue loading pages

Planned Features:
- Comment removal to shrink code further
- A reversal utility (LHS2TXT)
